Help wanted
-----------
Most of the JavaScript code in this directory dates back to the the early 2000's, before the Ajax was introduced.
jQuery didn't exist yet, but now I'm re-implementing the WorkArea concept from the original pre-2006 Terra-Terra
(now as the ContainerWindowPlugin), for the time being I just copy this JS code for quick reuse.

There scripts must be completely rewritten, probably using jQuery.
Any help is appreciated ;)
