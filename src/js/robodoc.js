/****I* Terra-Terra/Introduction
 * NAME
 *  Terra-Terra-JS - JavaScript library for Terra-Terra
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  Terra-Terra is a development framework for webbased applications.</p>
 *
 *  The aim is an environment that combines the best of several worlds; easy of use from Windows, flexibility from Linux, robustness from OpenVMS and of course internet's platform and location independency.
 *
 *  Together with Terra-Terra ( href:http://tt.oveas.com/docs/terra-terra/index.html ), you might consider the TT family as the basis of what Web2.2 will look like ;)
 *
 *  Much of this code started as the project Terra-Terra in 2001 ( http://terra-terra.org ), a project that was abandoned when AJAX became popular from 2005 onwards. In 2007 the new project OWL-PHP/OWL-JS was created,
 *  which was in 2014 renamed back to to Terra-Terra.
 *
 *  Terra-Terra/JS contains many open source scripts that have been collected and sometimes modified to work with the OWL family.
