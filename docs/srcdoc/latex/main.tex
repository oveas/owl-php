Oveas Web Library for PHP is a development framework for webbased applications.

The aim is an environment that combines the best of several worlds; ease of use from Windows, flexibility from Linux, robustness from OpenVMS and of course internet's platform and location independency. The design principles of OWL-\/PHP ensure a 100\% safe web development platform; since the library itself is unhackable, so are the applications built with it!

Together with the planned OWL-\/JS, you might consider the \doxyref{OWL}{p.}{classOWL} family as the basis of what Web2.2 will look like ;)

Much of this code started as the project Terra-\/Terra in 2001 ({\tt http://terra-\/terra.org}), a project that was abandoned when AJAX became popular from 2005 onwards. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
