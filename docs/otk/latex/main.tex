The OWL \doxyref{TestKit}{p.}{classTestKit} (\doxyref{OTK}{p.}{classOTK}) is an {\tt OWL} application that has been written for automated testing of the OWL functionalitaty. \doxyref{OTK}{p.}{classOTK} contains a simple framework and testsets, which can be easily added by creating a new testset directory and the required files (testset.php and one ore more testcases in case.$\ast$.php)

For a description of the testset class, refer to the documentation of the \doxyref{TestSet}{p.}{classTestSet} base class. Testcases should implement the \doxyref{TestCase}{p.}{interfaceTestCase} base class.
